# Tableau to Monday.com Web Data Connector
This project uses the Tableau Web Data Connector SDK. The files in the TableauMondayConnector folder have been written to extract data from Monday.com, so it can be accessed by Tableau to create visualisations and conduct data analysis.
You will need to add your Monday.com API key and Monday.com workspace ID to the JavaScript file.
